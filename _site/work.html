          A data visualization/reporting web application using the Bokeh python library for Infinite Uptime.  The application features multiple 'tabs' for displaying data in different interactable formats, and a responsive menu for device and time interval selection. It also features data cacheing and automatically adjusts between different data summary tracks to maintain a readable granularity. The project uses Docker with a Cloud SQL Proxy and was deployed to Google Kubernetes.
